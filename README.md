# OPEN-PBL APP

**OPEN-PBL**<br>
OPEN-PBL is an open source software (OSS) that manages problem-based learning (PBL) experiences. Schools and educational institutions are free to use OPEN-PBL to ensure that the planning, implementation and measurement of the effectiveness of their learning experiences fully follow the theoretical framework of the PBL.<br><br>

OPEN-PBL can be used by educational institutions and companies to:
* Add PBL experiences to their existing education systems or;
* Deploy new student-centered educational systems.<br><br>

To ensure that the PBL tutorial process is fully implemented, OPEN-PBL promotes teacher-student interaction with the aim of:
* Assisting teachers in the creation and dissemination of “problem scenarios” (PC) and the assessment of student performance in these PC discussion classes; 
* Assist students in the individual research and learning of the academic topics needed for PC analysis and preparation of the arguments to be presented in the discussion classes.<br><br>

**ENVIRONMENTS AND FEATURES**<br>
OPEN-PBL uses Google Classroom (GC) as the default interface for interaction with the actors involved in the learning process. The interaction is made in the following environments:
* Individual GC environment of interaction with each student;
* Individual GC environment of interaction with each teacher;
* GC environment shared by teachers, dedicated to the elaboration and classification of a specific PC; 
* Individual GC environment of interaction with each student, dedicated to research and proficiency assessment of each subject, prerequisite for the analysis of a PC;
* GC environment shared by a group of students, dedicated to the preliminary study and the elaboration of the arguments of the PC analysis;
* GC environment shared by students and teachers, intended for preliminary preparation for PC discussion classes;<br><br>

The main features offered by OPEN-PBL in GC teacher and student interaction environments are: 
* Assisting teachers in the structured creation of PC;
* Disseminate the PC and all complementary material associated with the interested students;
* Assess students' proficiency in academic topics, prerequisites for PC analysis;
* Assist the teacher in the preparation and execution of PC discussion classes;
* Record student participation in PC discussion classes;
* Assist in the evaluation and classification of student participation in PC discussion classes;<br><br>


**CONCEPT AND DEVELOPMENT**<br>
OPEN-PBL's conceptualization and strategic design process originated from research in the PhD program of the PUC-Rio Department of Informatics.  Currently, the development of the code is coordinated by non-profit OPEN-PBL.ORG and follows the practices suggested by the international associations for the creation, versioning and licensing of free code. <br><br>

**LICENSING **<br>
OPEN-PBL's license to use is *** and its code, as well as all instructions for its safe deployment, can be accessed at www.open-pbl.org.<br><br>

**PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING**<br>
OPEN-PBL.ORG maintains, in partnership with The Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-Based Learning, an information monitor on new academic studies and PBL application cases. The content is aimed at teachers, educators, T&D professionals and education executives interested in following discussions about the PBL learning strategy. <br><br>

**SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL ACTIONS**<br>
OPEN-PBL.ORG maintains a voluntary consultancy program for the free implementation of the OPEN-PBL application for use in educational initiatives by municipal governments and social actions.  <br><br>
