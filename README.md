## OPEN-PBL APP 

OPEN-PBL is an **open source** software that manages **problem-based learning (PBL)** strategies. Educational institutions can use **for free** the OPEN-PBL APP to ensure that their learning experiences are aligned with PBL best practices and theoretical framework. Micro and small businesses can also take advantage of the benefits of the PBL approach and use **for free** the OPEN-PBL APP in their employee training and development.<br>

**What is PBL**
Problem-based learning (PBL) is the base of an *educational strategy* used by various higher education institutions to train professionals with higher skills. Harvard, Minerva and School 42 are some examples of successful initiatives in the use of PBL. From the PBL approach students learn by **solving problems** and **reflecting on their experiences**. PBL's strength lies in its *pragmatism* and the appropriateness of its learning dynamics, which contributes to accelerating students' employability gains in the labor market. <br>

**Why Few Schools Adopt PBL** <br>
Despite the advantages, adopting an educational architecture based on PBL has a far greater cost than other methods, and is poorly scalable as it requires scarce academic resources in general. <br><br>

**Why use the OPEN-PBL APP** <br>
To ensure proper **application** and **measurement of the effectiveness** of educational architecture in order to:
- Deploy **educational systems** entirely student-centered, via the use of PBL; or
- **Add PBL dynamics** to their proprietary education systems.<br><br>

**How OPEN-PBL APP acts** <br>
OPEN-PBL APP manages the execution of **sequential tracks of synchronous sessions** (in person or not) to discuss issues such as classes for *case studies*, sessions for **drafting projects** and more. To ensure the integrity of the application of PBL tutorial process, OPENPBL APP:

a) **Interacts with teachers** to help them:<br>
- In the **creation and dissemination of “case-problems” (CP)** and;
- In the **evaluation of student performance** in these CP discussion classes;

b) **Interacts with students** to help them:<br>
- In **individual research and learning** of academic knowledge, necessary for the analysis of CP and;
- In the **preparation of the individual arguments** be presented in the discussion classes. <br><br>

### OPEN-PBL CONCEPTUALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT 

The process of conceptualizing and outlining the architecture of OPEN-PBL APP originated from doctoral research from the Department of Informatics of PUC-Rio. Currently, code development is coordinated by OPEN-PBL.ORG, which is responsible for applying best international practices for the creation, versioning and licensing of **free code**. <br>

**Universalization of PBL** <br>
The primary mission of OPEN-PBL.ORG is to foster the use of PBL by social organizations, governments and small businesses that would otherwise not have access to the resources required for its adoption. <br>

**Licensing** <br>
The license to use OPEN-PBL APP is BSD. The code as well as all instructions for its secure deployment can be accessed at github.com/openpbl. <br>

**Monitor of PBL practices**<br>
OPEN-PBL.ORG maintains, in partnership with *”The Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-Based Learning”*, the publication of a monitor of new **academic studies and PBL application cases**. The content of **PBL Monitor** is aimed at teachers, educators, T&D professionals, and education executives interested in following developments and discussions about the PBL learning strategy. <br>

**Support for social actions** <br>
OPEN-PBL.ORG maintains a voluntary consultancy program for the free implementation of the OPEN-PBL application in educational initiatives promoted by municipal governments and non-profit organizations.<br><br>

### OPEN-PBL ENVIRONMENTS AND FEATURES 

**Virtual Learning Environments** <br>
OPEN-PBL uses the virtual environment of the **Google Classroom** (GC)  free application as the default interface for interacting with (and between) the actors involved in the learning process. The interaction is made in the following environments:
- GC environment of individual interaction with each student;
- GC environment of individual interaction with each teacher;
- GC environment shared by groups of teachers, dedicated to the structured development of each “case-problem” (CP); 
- GC environment of individual interaction with each student, dedicated to research and proficiency assessment in each subject prerequisite for PC analysis;
- GC environment shared by groups of students, dedicated to the preliminary study and the elaboration of the arguments of PC analysis;
- GC environment shared by students and teachers, intended for preliminary preparation for PC discussion classes;<br><br>

**Instructional planning and design** <br>
Key functionalities for instructional planning and execution provided by OPEN-PBL APP in the teacher and student interaction GC environments are: 
- Assist teachers in the structured creation of CP;
- Disseminate the PC and all complementary material associated with the interested students;
- Evaluate students' proficiency in academic topics, prerequisites for CP analysis;
- Assist the teacher in the preparation and execution of CP discussion classes;
- Record student participation in CP discussion classes;
- Assist in the evaluation and classification of student participation in CP discussion classes;<br><br>

**Learning experiences** <br>
Key features for managing learning experiences provided by OPEN-PBL APP in GC teacher and student interaction environments are: 
- Create a conducive environment for research on each prerequisite subject for CP analysis;
- Create an environment for discussion among students to elaborate the arguments of CP analysis;
- Create an environment for consolidated explanation of the collective learning generated in each discussion session of a CP;<br><br>
